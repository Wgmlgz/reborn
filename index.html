We appreciate power
We appreciate power, power
What will it take to make you capitulate?
We appreciate power
We appreciate power
Elevate the human race, putting makeup on my face
We appreciate power
We appreciate power, power
Simulation, give me something good
God's creation, so misunderstood
Pray to the divinity, the keeper of the key
One day everyone will believe
What will it take to make you capitulate?

We appreciate power
We appreciate power, power
People like to say that we're insane
But AI will reward us when it reigns
Pledge allegiance to the world's most powerful computer
Simulation: it's the future
What will it take to make you capitulate?

Baby, plug in, upload your mind
Come on, you're not even alive
If you're not backed up on a drive

If you're not backed up, backed up on a drive
